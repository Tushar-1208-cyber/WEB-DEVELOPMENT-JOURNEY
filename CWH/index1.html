    <!-- <pre>
        Computer programming or coding is the
        composition of sequences of instructions called 
        programs, that computers can follow to perform
        tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing
        algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures,
        by writing code in one or more programming
        languages. Programmers typically use high-level
        programming languages that are more easily
        intelligible to humans than machine code, which is
        directly executed by the central processing unit. 
        Proficient programming usually requires expertise in 
        several different subjects, including knowledge of the 
        application domain, details of programming
        languages and generic code libraries, specialized 
        algorithms, and formal logic
    </pre> -->

    <!-- <pre>
        Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, 
        debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management 
        of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered 
        programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process – with the 
        terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per 
        se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it 
        employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process
